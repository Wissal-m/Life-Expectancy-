This project aims to study the Life Expectancy of people from 50 different countries with Linear Regression. 
Using 5 variables : Birth Rate, Death Rate, BMI, GDP & percentage of Alcohol Consumers, we implemented a Multiple Linear Regression Model to see how each of these variables impact the life expectancy in different countries.
